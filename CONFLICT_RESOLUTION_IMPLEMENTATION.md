# Conflict Resolution System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a comprehensive conflict resolution system for iCloud syncing in the Channer app.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created ConflictResolutionManager

- **File**: `/Channer/Utilities/ConflictResolutionManager.swift`
- Provides a singleton manager for detecting and resolving sync conflicts
- Supports multiple conflict types: favorites, history, categories, themes, settings
- Offers different resolution strategies: merge, takeLocal, takeRemote, askUser
- Implements timestamp tracking for conflict detection

### 2. Created ConflictResolutionViewController

- **File**: `/Channer/ViewControllers/Home/ConflictResolutionViewController.swift`
- Provides UI for manual conflict resolution
- Shows both local and remote data with timestamps
- Allows users to choose between keeping local data, iCloud data, or merging both

### 3. Updated ICloudSyncManager

- Modified to use ConflictResolutionManager for conflict detection
- Added `resolveDataConflict` method to handle conflicts
- Updated `syncFromiCloud` to handle theme conflicts properly
- Added timestamp updates for tracking data modifications

### 4. Updated FavoritesManager

- Added conflict detection when loading favorites
- Implements intelligent merging of local and cloud favorites
- Updates timestamps when saving favorites
- Provides fallback to local storage if conflict resolution fails

### 5. Updated HistoryManager

- Similar updates as FavoritesManager
- Handles conflicts between local and cloud history data
- Updates timestamps for conflict tracking

### 6. Updated AppDelegate

- Implements ConflictResolutionDelegate protocol
- Presents ConflictResolutionViewController when conflicts are detected
- Provides utility methods to find the top view controller for presenting UI

## Files to Add to Xcode Project

The following new files need to be added to the Xcode project:

1. `/Channer/Utilities/ConflictResolutionManager.swift`
2. `/Channer/ViewControllers/Home/ConflictResolutionViewController.swift`

## Build Status

The implementation is complete but requires the new files to be added to the Xcode project before it will build successfully.

## Next Steps

1. Add the new files to the Xcode project following the instructions in `ADD_TO_XCODE_PROJECT.md`
2. Build the project to verify the implementation
3. Test conflict resolution scenarios with multiple devices
4. Monitor for any issues during real-world usage
