# Enhanced Thread Bookmarking Feature

## Summary
Successfully implemented an enhanced thread bookmarking system with categorization support for saved/offline threads.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Model
- Created `BookmarkCategory` struct with properties for id, name, color, icon, and timestamps
- Added `categoryId` property to `ThreadData` struct to associate threads with categories
- Integrated category support in `CachedThread` for offline storage

### 2. FavoritesManager Updates
- Added category management methods (create, update, delete, get categories)
- Enhanced favorite management to support category assignment
- Implemented default categories: General, To Read, Important, Archives
- Added ability to move favorites between categories

### 3. User Interface
- Created `CategoryManagerViewController` for managing categories
- Implemented `CategorizedFavoritesViewController` with segmented control for category navigation
- Updated thread bookmarking flow to show category selection when favoriting
- Added category color indicators using SF Symbols and hex colors

### 4. Offline Support Integration
- Extended `ThreadCacheManager` to support category-based thread caching
- Added methods to filter cached threads by category
- Synchronized category changes between favorites and cached threads

### 5. Build Status
âœ… Project builds successfully with only minor warnings

## Key Features
1. **Category Management**: Create, edit, and delete custom categories
2. **Visual Organization**: Color-coded categories with SF Symbol icons
3. **Seamless Navigation**: Segmented control to switch between categories
4. **Offline Support**: Cached threads maintain their category assignments
5. **Bulk Operations**: Move threads between categories, delete categories with automatic reassignment

## Notes
The implementation uses inline temporary definitions for some structs and view controllers until they are properly added to the Xcode project. These files exist on disk but need to be added to the project file:
- `/Users/x/Documents/GitHub/Channer/Channer/ViewControllers/Home/BookmarkCategory.swift`
- `/Users/x/Documents/GitHub/Channer/Channer/ViewControllers/Home/CategoryManagerViewController.swift`
- `/Users/x/Documents/GitHub/Channer/Channer/ViewControllers/Home/CategorizedFavoritesViewController.swift`

## Next Steps
1. Add the new files to the Xcode project
2. Test the feature on device/simulator
3. Consider adding animation transitions between categories
4. Add search/filter functionality within categories
5. Allow custom icon selection for categories
